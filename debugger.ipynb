      "   - To analyze how these variables are changing over the years, consider grouping your data by year and calculating the mean for each variable. Visualizing this data with line plots can help you observe trends. Pay attention to the slopes of the lines in your plots to determine if the trends are increasing or decreasing.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Relationship Between Max Rain and Max Humidity**:\n",
      "   - To quantify the strength of the relationship, consider using Pearson's correlation coefficient. You might want to explore functions available in libraries like `scipy` for this purpose. Visualizing the relationship with a scatter plot could also provide insights into how the two variables correlate.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Visualizations and Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "- Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualizations. Line plots for univariate analysis and scatter plots for bivariate analysis will be helpful.\n",
