      "1. **Average Temperature, Minimum Humidity, and Average Wind Speed**: To analyze how these variables are changing across the years, consider using visualizations such as line plots or bar charts. Think about how you might group your data by year and calculate the mean for each variable. The Pandas documentation on [groupby](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/groupby.html) could be a useful resource for this (Phase P, Week W8, Date D1, Page 25).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Year with Highest Maximum Record Rainfall**: You might want to explore how to identify the year with the highest maximum rainfall by examining the relevant column in your dataset. The `max()` function could be useful here, and you can find more information in the documentation on [DataFrame.max()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.max.html) (Phase P, Week W8, Date D1, Page 25).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Bivariate Analysis\n",
      "1. **Relationship Between Max Rain and Max Humidity**: To understand the relationship between these two variables, consider calculating Pearson's correlation coefficient. You can use the `corr()` method in Pandas after filtering your data for Minas Gerais. The documentation on [DataFrame.corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) will provide guidance (Phase P, Week W8, Date D1, Page 25).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relationship Between Average Wind Speed and Average Temperature**: Similar to the previous analysis, think about how you can use the `corr()` method after filtering your data. Again, the documentation on [DataFrame.corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) will be helpful (Phase P, Week W8, Date D1, Page 25).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Additional Tips\n",
      "- For filtering your DataFrame to only include Minas Gerais, consider using boolean indexing. The documentation on [boolean indexing](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#boolean-indexing) will assist you with this (Phase P, Week W8, Date D1, Page 25).\n",
      "- When dealing with null values, think about how you might use the `dropna()` method. You can find more information in the documentation on [DataFrame.dropna()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) (Phase P, Week W8, Date D1, Page 25).\n",

    "For your **Univariate Analysis**, focus on how the variables are changing over the years and their distributions. Make sure you're filtering your data correctly to only include rows for Minas Gerais. You can use the Pandas library to filter your DataFrame. If you're unsure how to do this, I suggest looking into the Pandas documentation on filtering DataFrames. You can find relevant information in:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Univariate Analysis**: For your analysis on average temperature, minimum humidity, and average wind speed, make sure you're correctly filtering your dataset for Minas Gerais. Consider using Pandas to filter the DataFrame based on the region. After filtering, think about how you might analyze trends over the years using methods like `.mean()`, `.min()`, and `.groupby()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bivariate Analysis**: When exploring the relationship between variables, you might want to look into how to calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient. The `scipy.stats` library could be useful here, particularly the `pearsonr()` function, which provides both the correlation coefficient and the p-value.\n",

    "3. **Handling Null Values**: Before performing any analysis, it's essential to clean your data. You can explore methods in Pandas for handling missing data, such as removing rows with null values.\n",

    "4. **Visualizations**: For visualizing trends and distributions, consider using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. They offer tools for creating various plots that can help you visualize your findings effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "For specific documentation references, I recommend checking out the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pandas Documentation**: Look at the sections on data filtering and handling missing data. This will help you with filtering for Minas Gerais and removing null values. You can find this in Phase 1, Week 8, Day 1, on page 26 of the Shopping Dataset Case Study.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **SciPy Documentation**: For Pearson's correlation coefficient, refer to the SciPy documentation on statistics. This will guide you on how to use the `pearsonr()` function effectively. You can find this in Phase 1, Week 8, Day 3, on page 47 of the AB Testing document.\n",
